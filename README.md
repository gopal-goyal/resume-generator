### Project Documentation

- **app.py - Main Application Logic**  
  This file is where the core functionality lives. It hosts the user interface (UI) created with Streamlit and collects inputs for the resume. It also handles saving the data and calling the resume creation logic.

- **resume_creation.py - Resume Generation Logic**  
  This file is responsible for taking the collected data and turning it into a professional resume using the `python-docx` library. It formats the content into sections such as contact information, skills, experience, and education.

- **data.json - User Data Storage**  
  Stores the user's resume data in JSON format. Each resume submission appends new data to this file, allowing users to track their inputs or make changes later.

### Testing and Quality Assurance

Weâ€™ve written comprehensive tests to ensure that the resume generation process is smooth and reliable. The project includes several tests for different types of data inputs and edge cases.
